To evaluate a workflow that uses a Telegram trigger and output, you cannot rely solely on the Telegram Trigger itself because evaluations require a controlled dataset. Instead, you must modify your workflow to accept input from both the live Telegram Trigger and the **Evaluation Trigger**.
Here is the step-by-step process:

### 1. Combine Multiple Triggers
Since you cannot have multiple evaluation triggers, but you can have multiple workflow triggers, you need to set up a dual-entry system.
*   Keep your existing **Telegram Trigger** (for production use).
*   Add an **Evaluation Trigger** node. This node will pull test cases from a dataset (e.g., Google Sheets) containing sample user inputs [[Evaluation Trigger node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.evaluationtrigger/#evaluation-trigger-node)].

### 2. Mock the Telegram Data Structure
Your workflow logic likely expects a specific JSON structure provided by Telegram (e.g., `json.message.text` or `json.message.chat.id`). The Evaluation Trigger will simply output the columns from your dataset, which won't match the Telegram format. You must re-shape the evaluation data to match the Telegram data:

1.  **Get the Telegram format:** Execute your Telegram Trigger once, go to the JSON view of the output, and copy the data [[Tips and common issues](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/evaluations/tips-and-common-issues/#tips-and-common-issues)].
2.  **Add an Edit Fields (Set) node:** Place this immediately after the **Evaluation Trigger**.
3.  **Map the fields:** Configure this Set node to output the exact JSON structure your workflow expects. Use expressions to map your dataset columns (e.g., your "Input" column) into the simulated Telegram structure (e.g., mapping "Input" to `message.text`) [[Tips and common issues](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/evaluations/tips-and-common-issues/#tips-and-common-issues)].

### 3. Merge the Branches
To ensure the rest of your workflow runs regardless of which trigger started it:
*   Add a **No-op** node.
*   Connect both the **Telegram Trigger** and the **Edit Fields (Set)** node (coming from the Evaluation Trigger) to the input of the No-op node.
*   Connect the output of the No-op node to the rest of your workflow logic (e.g., your AI Agent or processing nodes) [[Tips and common issues](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/evaluations/tips-and-common-issues/#tips-and-common-issues)].

### 4. Capture the Output
You need to record the results generated by your workflow into your dataset.
*   Add an **Evaluation node** configured to the **Set Outputs** operation [[Evaluation node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.evaluation/#evaluation-node)].
*   Connect this node to the end of your workflow, after the logic has generated a response.
*   Map the workflow's generated response to the corresponding output column in your dataset.

### 5. Prevent "Double" Sending (Optional)
If you want to avoid sending actual Telegram messages during an evaluation run:
*   Use the **Evaluation node** with the **Check If Evaluating** operation.
*   Place this node before your final **Telegram output node**.
*   Connect the **False** output to the Telegram node (so real messages send during production).
*   Connect the **True** output to the **Set Outputs** evaluation node (so you record the data without spamming a Telegram chat) [[Evaluation node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.evaluation/#evaluation-node)].
